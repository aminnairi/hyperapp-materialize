# How to contribute to `hyperappp-materialize`?

## Spread the word!

This package needs (and will always need) people to test things out and give feedback on how to improve this package. The more we are, the better. Besides, this package is also a community work and you'll probably be using it for your own project.

## Try browsing issue and give feedback

I'll do my best to answer issues and resolve them (or people interested will). But it's always good to have multiple people confirming a bug or infirming it.

## Help the others!

I know there is always the documentation that can be pointed to. You can help people that are not yet conforatble either in JavaScript, or JSX, or even with NPM and are having trouble installing or else. Don't be closed to one thing and try to open to others. They will reward you times hundred. Sometimes, just looking at how long the documentation for something is can discourage people that might ust be able to do it if they are helped by the people of the open-source community.
